        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
        <p>I was born in Queensland (Australia), my parents and I moved to Melbourne (Victoria) in 2003, when I was roughly 3 years old. I have spoken English all my life and unfortunately, I don’t know how to speak any additional languages, maybe if I ever travel overseas in the future, I’ll try to learn one</p>
        <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I regularly talk with friends online to either play video games together or just to catch up and chat. Before the pandemic I was occasionally going on trips with friends and family throughout Victoria, hopefully that changes in 2021.</p>
      <h3>Education and Certificates</h3>
      <ul>
  <li>Certificate III in Creative Digital Media</li>
  <li>Cisco Networking Academy (Box Hill Institute)</li>
  <li>Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA Melbourne)</li>
  <li>High School Grad (VCE) (Warrandyte High School)</li>
</ul>
      </div>

      <div class="main">
        <h2 id="Interest in IT">Interest in IT</h2>
        My Interest in IT probably started around the time I got my first computer, a HP Pavilion Dv6000s series laptop (If I recall correctly), which was given to me as a gift for my 8th birthday. Mainly used to browse the Internet, watch movies, and “run” computer games. My parents were probably hoping I would use it mainly for school.
 <p>The areas of IT that I have been interested in throughout my life have been Networking, Web Development, and Information Tech Security/Cybersecurity. Although, it is hard to say which area is my ‘main interest’, as I often find that it changes almost weekly. The perfect example was that I originally started high school hoping to be a commercial pilot and then I switched towards IT later.</p>
 <p>Another contributing factor that almost certainly helped shape my interest in IT and Security was my Dad, who for as long as I can remember has worked in heavily oriented IT and Security related positions. He constantly gave me bits of computers, phones, routers etc to use and fiddle around with and use.</p>
 However, up until high school, I did not get into IT related stuff seriously besides using it as a form of entertainment or a tool for searching and organizing things. Around this time was also when most people I knew and were friends with started to use social media, friends of mine without us noticing would often have conversations around things involving technology, whether it was entertainment & media or changes to various industries etc.
 Most of my subjects in compulsory schooling were either digital media-oriented or programming and game design centred. For my work experience placement when I was 16, I got to assist and somewhat work alongside various IT professionals at both Wipro Limited and NBN, again this opportunity came about thanks to my dad who at the time was working at a high-level position in NBN. Subsequently, for the rest of my VCE, I completed the various Cisco CCNA Networking Academy courses in Routing and Switching.<br></p>

 <p>The reason I chose to study at RMIT doing a Bachelor of Information Technology was a result of the university's excellent reputation for teaching and running its information technology-related courses like computer science, software engineering etc. So naturally, for someone like myself looking to get a degree in the field of IT and further explore the areas and what working in IT might be like, it was an easy decision for me to make.
<p> I hope that throughout my studies and at the end, I will have a much clearer understanding of some areas of IT that I do not have any experience in, and IT working environment and workflow. Potentially discovering what I aim to specifically do for a career in information technology.</p>

        <h4>Job Title: Cyber Security Analyst</h4>
        <img src="seek_job.png" alt="Cyber Security Analyst Job Listing" width="652" height="2629" class="centre">
        <h4>Job Description:</h4>
        <p>Work for Alinta Energy, an established Australian energy generator and retailer. In the role of a Cyber Security Analyst undertaking key responsibilities for reviewing, monitoring, analysing, and responding to cyber-related threats and attacks in the various systems of Alinta Energy.</p>
        <h4>The requirements for this position:</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Considerable experience in IT with a focus on incident management.</li>
          <li>High-level problem solving and analytical skills.</li>
          <li>Long track record of handling multiple priorities at the same time with the power to evolve to changing needs while maintaining deadlines.</li>

          <li>Robust attention to detail and critical thinking skills.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h4>Why I’m Interested in this IT position</h4>
          <p>Everyone and everything that has some form of digital information is going to require some form of Cybersecurity infrastructure and policies unless they want to open the door to malicious attacks and vulnerabilities. As more of today's world transitions towards easily accessible electronic devices, more data is also available to potential criminals.</p>
          <p>As someone with ADHD, I have always sought out something that has a lot of variety while both been engaging and challenging. The opportunity to work towards a goal with new and different tactics that evolve and change constantly is something that makes working as a Cybersecurity analyst or in the field of cybersecurity appealing to me. Honestly, I am struggling to put into words why this type of job has always interested me, but I do not see myself doing anything else that did not have something to do with Cybersecurity or IT security as a career later in life.</p>
          <h4>Current Experience and Qualifications:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Experience working in roles that require attention to detail and quick thinking</li>
          <li>Intermediate to high-level computer literacy & skills. </li>
          <li>Knowledge of operations and setup of small business networks specifically with Cisco equipment and systems.</li>
          <li>Completed Cisco CCNA Academy 1-4 Routing and Switching at Box Hill Institute.</li>
          <li>Certificate III in Screen and Media. </li>
          <li>Worked in several roles having to juggle multiple tasks and prioritizes.</li>
          <li>Some experience working in IT support and incident positions.</li>
          <li>Able to effectively troubleshoot mid-level IT issues in hardware and software.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To get myself to the point of being able to meet the requirements for the position of a Cyber Security Analyst, I would first plan on completing my Bachelor of Information Technology and then go about obtaining any relevant industry certificates such as CompTIA Certs: Net+ and Sec+. Either during my studies or after I would plan to start getting some industry experience in roles with transferable skills and knowledge to Cybersecurity Analyst positions.</p>
        <h5>For recommendations on industry certificates for cybersecurity and IT security professionals refer to information maintained by CompTIA (CompTIA, 2018) (CompTIA, n.d)</h5>

        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>My results for each of these tests does not surprise me, however, that does not mean that I cannot find them helpful or interesting. The ability to get a clearer and more specific understanding of my potential strengths and weaknesses I think is going to be incredibly beneficial to the team in any future work.</p>
        <p>My behaviour in a team might be influenced by how the information, communication and content are discussed and presented as indicated by the results of the learning styles test pointing towards been a mainly audio and visual learner. So, it might be worth pointing that out to avoid any miscommunication between me and the team.</p>
        <p>Taking the results into account when creating a team for the project and establishing a way to allow myself and the others to play to their strengths I think is the best course of action to take. Although in saying that, the results of these tests are not overly specific in their descriptions and “diagnosis” and are not too entirely accurate, so keeping that in mind and not making assumptions about what everyone can and cannot do when working together based solely on these results is something I can avoid.</p>

        <h1 id="IT Project Idea"> Information Technology Project</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>An external mobile or computer application interface used to organize and inform users of a shared household, the internal status of dishes (clean or dirty) and the current capacity of space in the Dishwasher through a wide array of easy-to-understand user-selected prompts and options that are viewed by local members or those who use the same dishwasher. It attempts to mitigate the mixing of different states of dishes (clean or dirty) and over stacking in the dishwasher.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>Research shows that ‘11.92 million Australians (58%) now own a dishwasher, up over 2.2 million(+8pps) from four years ago (Ray Morgan 2019, para 1). Now that report was from 2019, so It is not too unreasonable to assume that roughly the same percentage of Australians if not slightly more own and use a dishwasher, especially after a widespread pandemic resulting in people staying at home more now than ever before.</p>
        <p>The app will take advantage of the widespread android smartphone communications by giving users robust options for effective and constant communication allowing them to plan and organize around the use of the dishwasher. Setting out to eliminate things like wasteful dishwasher cycles and scenarios where other members of a household require dishes which are still been cleaned and many others.  Some future improvements like being able to put it on at off-peak electricity usage times to save money is something which should be explored at a later point intime.</p>
        <p>The app will take advantage of the widespread android smartphone communications by giving users robust options for effective and constant communication allowing them to plan and organize around the use of the dishwasher. Setting out to eliminate things like wasteful dishwasher cycles and scenarios where other members of a household require dishes which are still been cleaned and many others.  Some future improvements like being able to put it on at off-peak electricity usage times to save money is something which should be explored at a later point intime.</p>

        <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
        <p>Upon application installation or initial launch, you will be greeted with a list of options and filters that will allow you to specifically pick what and how you want to use the application. The available filters and options include the number of people that will be using the dishwasher/application, how many times and how frequently on average a day/hour/week/month you use the dishwasher, notifications settings for other users in your local group. The application will only plan and be able to support one dishwasher per household (at this stage). These options will be implemented to appear and interact somewhat like group fitness apps and others of the same liking. The effect these filters will have on the overall experience will be is the pre-determined or autocomplete (but still customizable) suggestions and options. An example of why such as system would exist is to prevent every time a user goes to change status, they do not need to select from such an overwhelming number of options that might not apply to their living situation. Of course, in saying that users will still have the option to show advanced options or “more options” when updating and organizing planned dishwasher cycles with their group.</p>
        <p>After setting up the filters and options, users will be asked to create a private group with a unique QR invite code allowing others of their choosing to receive notifications, group messages and view a timeline. The timeline will contain information such as when the dishwasher was last emptied and at what time, what type of dishes were unloaded and or loaded with a rough percentage of “Plates, Bowls, Glasses etc”.</p>
        <p>When putting on a dirty dishwasher load users will be able to go into the application and set a timer for the dishwasher, setting the time the same as on the dishwasher load will send a notification to the other users in the said group making sure no matter if no one’s at the house that whoever gets home first will be able to open the app and check the timer in the app to see when the load finished or if it's still going based on the time or notification sent. After a user also unloads the dishwasher, they will be able to select an option to confirm the load has been unpacked, this will also either send a notification or be a checkable status in-app. If not, all dishes are unpacked or packed the user will be able to select an option specifying a partial completion of the process and what state the dishwasher was in upon selecting that option (Clean or Dirty).</p>
        <p>Users who are not the group owner/creator will receive an invite from the group owner/creator, after accepting the invite to the named group they will be able to view the other members of the group and will begin to receive notifications as other users in the same group as they update the status, state etc of the dishwasher. The entire group will be able to vote on (if they choose to) any purposed future cycles, allowing others to know if they have all their dishes etc ready to be put on and others to notify the group they are not ready.</p>

        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>The android mobile application will operate similarly to applications like WhatsApp, so will likely need to be programmed in Java & JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS3 and Ruby for the mobile and backend development. To support the Automation framework of reminders and notifications RSpec, Capybara and PhantomJS are likely to be required. Databases and file storage services such as PostgreSQL will also be necessary, for hosting the application communications and data services like Amazons Web Services are the best option for allowing this. Security, Authentication end to end encryption will be vital, as users will likely be sharing potentially personal information, this would require the use of a third-party application programming interface (or API) like Nexmo which could be implemented via using phone numbers to authenticate new or current users. However, if we were taking the route of supporting email addresses and being able to link social media accounts to the application in some form tools such as Facebook SDK and Twitter Kit might be necessary (Shevchenko, Ruby Garage 2020), (Zakreskaya, Ruby Garage 2020).</p>
        <p>In the area of hardware, compatible devices such as Windows PCs with sufficient hardware specs for development will be required and devices for testing.</p>

        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <p>A small team of skilled individuals will be needed for UI Design, Backend development and Android development with an understanding of the various programming languages and systems required for completion.</p>
        <p>Significant time will be required for development and thus team members will need to have experience working on long term projects and all that comes with it when developing this application. Programmers and team members will also need to use and communicate through MS Teams, Discord and or Zoom to support development in the case that not all can be present.</p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>After reaching the point of successful completion, the app will be put onto platforms like Kickstarter to gain support and offered to groups of individuals for further feedback. Finally, after establishing a loyal base of users and support, the app will be released with a free version with either a form of subscription, monetization or similar to keep it running for the future.</p>
        <p>The initial problem will be solved by allowing a more central way to go about planning and setting out times for, who, what, when and where the dishwasher will start and finish its cycle, who will be there or responsible for loading or unpacking. This will help eliminate or mitigate unplanned or mistimed cycles resolving disagreements and arguments at home.</p>
