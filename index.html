        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
        <p>I was born in Queensland (Australia), my parents and I moved to Melbourne (Victoria) in 2003, when I was roughly 3 years old. I have spoken English all my life and unfortunately, I don’t know how to speak any additional languages, maybe if I ever travel overseas in the future, I’ll try to learn one</p>
        <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I regularly talk with friends online to either play video games together or just to catch up and chat. Before the pandemic I was occasionally going on trips with friends and family throughout Victoria, hopefully that changes in 2021.</p>
      <h3>Education and Certificates</h3>
      <ul>
  <li>Certificate III in Creative Digital Media</li>
  <li>Cisco Networking Academy (Box Hill Institute)</li>
  <li>Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA Melbourne)</li>
  <li>High School Grad (VCE) (Warrandyte High School)</li>
</ul>

        <h2 id="Interest in IT">Interest in IT</h2>
        My Interest in IT probably started around the time I got my first computer, a HP Pavilion Dv6000s series laptop (If I recall correctly), which was given to me as a gift for my 8th birthday. Mainly used to browse the Internet, watch movies, and “run” computer games. My parents were probably hoping I would use it mainly for school.
 <p>The areas of IT that I have been interested in throughout my life have been Networking, Web Development, and Information Tech Security/Cybersecurity. Although, it is hard to say which area is my ‘main interest’, as I often find that it changes almost weekly. The perfect example was that I originally started high school hoping to be a commercial pilot and then I switched towards IT later.</p>
 <p>Another contributing factor that almost certainly helped shape my interest in IT and Security was my Dad, who for as long as I can remember has worked in heavily oriented IT and Security related positions. He constantly gave me bits of computers, phones, routers etc to use and fiddle around with and use.</p>
 However, up until high school, I did not get into IT related stuff seriously besides using it as a form of entertainment or a tool for searching and organizing things. Around this time was also when most people I knew and were friends with started to use social media, friends of mine without us noticing would often have conversations around things involving technology, whether it was entertainment & media or changes to various industries etc.
 Most of my subjects in compulsory schooling were either digital media-oriented or programming and game design centred. For my work experience placement when I was 16, I got to assist and somewhat work alongside various IT professionals at both Wipro Limited and NBN, again this opportunity came about thanks to my dad who at the time was working at a high-level position in NBN. Subsequently, for the rest of my VCE, I completed the various Cisco CCNA Networking Academy courses in Routing and Switching.<br></p>

 <p>The reason I chose to study at RMIT doing a Bachelor of Information Technology was a result of the university's excellent reputation for teaching and running its information technology-related courses like computer science, software engineering etc. So naturally, for someone like myself looking to get a degree in the field of IT and further explore the areas and what working in IT might be like, it was an easy decision for me to make.
<p> I hope that throughout my studies and at the end, I will have a much clearer understanding of some areas of IT that I do not have any experience in, and IT working environment and workflow. Potentially discovering what I aim to specifically do for a career in information technology.</p>

        <h4>Job Title: Cyber Security Analyst</h4>
        <img src="seek_job.png" alt="Cyber Security Analyst Job Listing" width="652" height="2629" class="centre">
        <h4>Job Description:</h4>
        <p>Work for Alinta Energy, an established Australian energy generator and retailer. In the role of a Cyber Security Analyst undertaking key responsibilities for reviewing, monitoring, analysing, and responding to cyber-related threats and attacks in the various systems of Alinta Energy.</p>
        <h4>The requirements for this position:</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Considerable experience in IT with a focus on incident management.</li>
          <li>High-level problem solving and analytical skills.</li>
          <li>Long track record of handling multiple priorities at the same time with the power to evolve to changing needs while maintaining deadlines.</li>
          <li>Knowledge working with vulnerability analysis and correction methods</li>
          <li>Experience in investigating and improvement of Cybersecurity systems.</li>
          <li>Have used data classification and administration tools.</li>
          <li>Robust attention to detail and critical thinking skills.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h4>Why I’m Interested in this IT position</h4>
          <p>Everyone and everything that has some form of digital information is going to require some form of Cybersecurity infrastructure and policies unless they want to open the door to malicious attacks and vulnerabilities. As more of today's world transitions towards easily accessible electronic devices, more data is also available to potential criminals.</p>
          <p>As someone with ADHD, I have always sought out something that has a lot of variety while both been engaging and challenging. The opportunity to work towards a goal with new and different tactics that evolve and change constantly is something that makes working as a Cybersecurity analyst or in the field of cybersecurity appealing to me. Honestly, I am struggling to put into words why this type of job has always interested me, but I do not see myself doing anything else that did not have something to do with Cybersecurity or IT security as a career later in life.</p>
          <h4>Current Experience and Qualifications:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Experience working in roles that require attention to detail and quick thinking</li>
          <li>Intermediate to high-level computer literacy & skills. </li>
          <li>Knowledge of operations and setup of small business networks specifically with Cisco equipment and systems.</li>
          <li>Completed Cisco CCNA Academy 1-4 Routing and Switching at Box Hill Institute.</li>
          <li>Certificate III in Screen and Media. </li>
          <li>Worked in several roles having to juggle multiple tasks and prioritizes.</li>
          <li>Some experience working in IT support and incident positions.</li>
          <li>Able to effectively troubleshoot mid-level IT issues in hardware and software.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To get myself to the point of being able to meet the requirements for the position of a Cyber Security Analyst, I would first plan on completing my Bachelor of Information Technology and then go about obtaining any relevant industry certificates such as CompTIA Certs: Net+ and Sec+. Either during my studies or after I would plan to start getting some industry experience in roles with transferable skills and knowledge to Cybersecurity Analyst positions.</p>
        <h5>For recommendations on industry certificates for cybersecurity and IT security professionals refer to information maintained by CompTIA (CompTIA, 2018) (CompTIA, n.d)</h5>

        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>My results for each of these tests does not surprise me, however, that does not mean I cannot find them helpful or interesting, as the ability to get a clearer and more specific understanding of my potential strengths and weaknesses I think is going to be incredibly beneficial to the team in future work.</p>
        <p>My behaviour in a team might be influenced by how the information, communication and content are discussed and presented as indicated by the results of the learning styles test pointing towards been a mainly audio and visual learner. So, it might be worth pointing that out to avoid any miscommunication between me and the team.</p>
        <p>Taking the results into account when creating a team for the project and establishing a way to allow myself and the others to play to their strengths I think is the best course of action to take. Although in saying that, the results of these tests are not overly specific in their descriptions and “diagnosis” and are not to entirely accurate, so keeping that in mind and not making assumptions about what everyone can a cannot do when working together based solely on these results is something I can avoid.</p>
