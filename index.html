        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
        <p>I was born in Queensland (Australia), my parents and I moved to Melbourne (Victoria) in 2003, when I was roughly 3 years old. I have spoken English all my life and unfortunately, I don’t know how to speak any additional languages, maybe if I ever travel overseas in the future, I’ll try to learn one</p>
        <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I regularly talk with friends online to either play video games together or just to catch up and chat. Before the pandemic I was occasionally going on trips with friends and family throughout Victoria, hopefully that changes in 2021.</p>
      <h3>Education and Certificates</h3>
      <ul>
  <li>Certificate III in Creative Digital Media</li>
  <li>Cisco Networking Academy (Box Hill Institute)</li>
  <li>Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA Melbourne)</li>
  <li>High School Grad (VCE) (Warrandyte High School)</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        My Interest in IT probably started around the time I got my first computer, a HP Pavilion Dv6000s series laptop (If I recall correctly), which was given to me as a gift for my 8th birthday. Mainly used to browse the Internet, watch movies, and “run” computer games. My parents were probably hoping I would use it mainly for school.
 <p>The areas of IT that I have been interested in throughout my life have been Networking, Web Development, and Information Tech Security/Cybersecurity. Although, it is hard to say which area is my ‘main interest’, as I often find that it changes almost weekly. The perfect example was that I originally started high school hoping to be a commercial pilot and then I switched towards IT later.</p>
 <p>Another contributing factor that almost certainly helped shape my interest in IT and Security was my Dad, who for as long as I can remember has worked in heavily oriented IT and Security related positions. He constantly gave me bits of computers, phones, routers etc to use and fiddle around with and use.</p>
 However, up until high school, I did not get into IT related stuff seriously besides using it as a form of entertainment or a tool for searching and organizing things. Around this time was also when most people I knew and were friends with started to use social media, friends of mine without us noticing would often have conversations around things involving technology, whether it was entertainment & media or changes to various industries etc.
 Most of my subjects in compulsory schooling were either digital media-oriented or programming and game design centred. For my work experience placement when I was 16, I got to assist and somewhat work alongside various IT professionals at both Wipro Limited and NBN, again this opportunity came about thanks to my dad who at the time was working at a high-level position in NBN. Subsequently, for the rest of my VCE, I completed the various Cisco CCNA Networking Academy courses in Routing and Switching.<br></p>

 <p>The reason I chose to study at RMIT doing a Bachelor of Information Technology was a result of the university's excellent reputation for teaching and running its information technology-related courses like computer science, software engineering etc. So naturally, for someone like myself looking to get a degree in the field of IT and further explore the areas and what working in IT might be like, it was an easy decision for me to make.
 I hope that throughout my studies and at the end, I will have a much clearer understanding of some areas of IT that I do not have any experience in, and IT working environment and workflow. Potentially discovering what I aim to specifically do for a career in information technology.
